DATASET_CONNECTION
#Connections datasets allow the drawing of straight or curved lines between any two nodes in the tree. Width, color and opacity can be set for each line.
#Optionally, arrowheads can be displayed on the lines.

#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#Each dataset can have a legend, which is defined using LEGEND_XXX fields below
#For each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label.
#Optionally, you can define an exact legend position using LEGEND_POSITION_X and LEGEND_POSITION_Y. To use automatic legend positioning, do NOT define these values
#Optionally, shape scaling can be present (LEGEND_SHAPE_SCALES). For each shape, you can define a scaling factor between 0 and 1.
#To order legend entries horizontally instead of vertically, set LEGEND_HORIZONTAL to 1
#Shape should be a number between 1 and 6, or any protein domain shape definition.
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#Angle can be any value between -80 and 80. With angle set to 0 lines will be straight.

#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages

DATA
#Each line defines a single connection between 2 nodes and consists of the following fields:
#NODE1,NODE2,WIDTH,COLOR,STYLE,LABEL
#all connection widths will be normalized based on the MAXIMUM_LINE_WIDTH specified for the whole dataset
#STYLE defines the connection line style, and can be one of 'normal' or 'dashed'.
#color can be specified in hexadecimal, RGB or RGBA notation (if transparency is required). Note that you cannot use COMMA as the delimiter if RGB or RGBA color notation is used.
