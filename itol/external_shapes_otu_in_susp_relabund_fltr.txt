DATASET_EXTERNALSHAPE
#Nodes have multiple values associated with them. Values will be displayed as geometric shapes of different sizes in columns outside the tree.
#Highest value in the dataset will have the largest size, and all others will be scaled down proportionally.
#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#Each dataset can have a legend, which is defined using LEGEND_XXX fields below
#For each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label.
#Optionally, you can define an exact legend position using LEGEND_POSITION_X and LEGEND_POSITION_Y. To use automatic legend positioning, do NOT define these values
#Optionally, shape scaling can be present (LEGEND_SHAPE_SCALES). For each shape, you can define a scaling factor between 0 and 1.
#To order legend entries horizontally instead of vertically, set LEGEND_HORIZONTAL to 1
#Shape should be a number between 1 and 6, or any protein domain shape definition.
#1: square
#2: circle
